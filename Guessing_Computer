'''Think about any number between 1 to 100 and computer will guess that number in few guesses. 
After every guess computer will ask you for your feedback where you have to enter "h", 
if the guessed number is greater than the number you've thought off. Simillarly enter "l", 
if the guessed number is less than the number inside your mind, 
and finally if computer guessed the number correctly, that's inside your mind, then enter "c".
Thereafter computer will display the correct number, that you've thought off. 

Enjoy :) '''
